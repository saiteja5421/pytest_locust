# Welcome to Medusa Framework Documentation

## Use Tabs or Search to navigate

Tabs:

1. Code References -> script will crawl over all functions in Medusa/steps folder. Caveat is that functions need to have docstrings otherwise it will not show on this page.
2. Readme-> script will look for all \*.md files from Medusa folder.
